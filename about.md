As Alan Perlis said, in the long run every program becomes rococo -- then rubble. This blog will end up rococo or rubble too.  

There are conflicts between everyday language and professional terminology. Word 'or' in everyday language means 'xor' in professional terminology, which means you can only choose one. That is why we sometimes use 'and/or' instead of 'or'.

Here, I replace 'or' with 'xor', so the description, 'Rococo xor Rubble' appear.
